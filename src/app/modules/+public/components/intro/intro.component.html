    <mat-card class="mat-elevation-z5">There are two players, and a deck of cards representing some of the Starfighters from a galaxy far far away.
       You can compare them to see which one would win. After one use, the card expires, so it cannot be used until you restart the game.
       You play until all cards expire. The person who won more duels, wins the match.
